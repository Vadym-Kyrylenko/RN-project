# RN-project
  This project is a mobile app for shopping. The client-side was created with React Native, Redux/Redux-saga. Server-side used Node.js, Express.js, and data stored in MongoDB via Mongoose. The app was created accordingly to RestAPI standards. The app includes a catalog of products with sorting, filtering and searching functionality, a separate page for each product, and a personal profile of the user. Also, React Navigation was used for a drawer menu. Users could authenticate via email or their social media (Google, Facebook, or Twitter) - (technologies used:  Passport.js). The roles of users are divided: unauthorized user, authorized user, admin, and blocked user. Each product page was a slider with details of the product, comments of users, and a chat, where users could leave messages in a real-time mode(Socket.io).
